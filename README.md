# java-buildpack-client
Prototype of a simple buildpack (https://buildpacks.io/) client for java.. 

Simple implementation of buildpack platform spec. 

Enough to run a stock build currently, and to raise discussion re platform spec, and requirements for a java build client. 

see src/com/redhat/buildpack/TestDriver for top level invocation.
